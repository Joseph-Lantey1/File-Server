## Project Objective

Lizzy runs a business that distributes documents such as wedding cards, admission forms, and more on behalf of various businesses to different users. While her business has been successful, she aims to scale it further. After conducting research, she identified that having a digital platform where these documents can be easily accessed and downloaded remotely is the solution to her scaling challenge. She has chosen you, based on recommendations from her network, to develop this platform.

## Customer Requirements

### Users

Users of the platform should be able to:

1. **Sign Up & Log In:** Users should be able to create an account using their email and password. The system should also support account verification. A password reset feature should be available for users who forget their passwords.

2. **Feed Page:** Users should have access to a feed page where they can view a list of files available for download.

3. **Search Functionality:** Users should be able to search for specific files within the file server.

4. **Send Files:** Users should be able to send files to email addresses through the platform.

### Admin

Administrators of the platform should have the following capabilities:

1. **Upload Files:** Admins should be able to upload files along with titles and descriptions.

2. **Track File Usage:** Admins should have access to statistics, including the number of downloads and the number of emails sent for each file.

## Deliverables

To successfully complete this project, the following deliverables are expected:

1. **Web Application Source Code:** The source code should be hosted on GitHub, utilizing Git flow. Commits should be well-organized, and the repository should include a well-written README file.

2. **ER Diagram:** Provide an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that illustrates the database design.

3. **Tech Stack:** The tech stack must include TypeScript and Node.js.

4. **Database:** Leverage a PostgreSQL database to store user data, files, and other relevant information.

5. **Automated Testing:** Implement automated unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

6. **Source Code Documentation:** Utilize Swagger or a similar tool to document the API endpoints and functionality of the web application.

7. **Deployment:** Deploy the web application and provide a link for Lizzy to access it.
